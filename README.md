## Clinical Trial on Novel Radioimmunotherapy in Malignant Glioma Patients

This project is based on the study conducted by Grana et al. (2002), which involved a non-randomized clinical trial to investigate the effectiveness of a novel radioimmunotherapy in patients with malignant glioma. The primary objective of the study is to compare the overall survival between two groups of patients: a control group that received the standard therapy and a treatment group that received the standard therapy along with radioimmunotherapy.
