## Clinical Trial on Novel Radioimmunotherapy in Malignant Glioma Patients

This project is based on the study conducted by Grana et al. (2002), which involved a non-randomized clinical trial to investigate the effectiveness of a novel radioimmunotherapy in patients with malignant glioma. The primary objective of the study is to compare the overall survival between two groups of patients: 
1. A control group that received the standard therapy
2. A treatment group that received the standard therapy along with radioimmunotherapy.

### Study Objective
The main focus of this project is to assess whether patients treated with the novel radioimmunotherapy have, on average, longer survival times compared to patients in the control group. The overall survival, defined as the time from the beginning of the therapy to the disease-caused death of the patient, serves as the primary outcome measure.

### Methodology
To achieve the study objective, the survival courses for the two treatment groups (control group and treatment group) will be constructed. Survival analysis techniques will be applied to estimate the survival curves and compare them between the groups.

Specifically, the log-rank test, a commonly used statistical test in survival analysis, will be employed to determine if there is a significant difference in survival times between patients treated with the novel radioimmunotherapy and those in the control group. The log-rank test allows for the comparison of survival distributions and helps evaluate the hypothesis that the two groups have similar survival experiences.
